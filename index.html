  <h3>Who are the SOBOYS?</h3>
  <p>The SOBOYS (SOuthBOund bOYS) are an eclectic group of hikers from the small town of Oxford, Ohio. The Boys have taken on small time hiking challenges such as the rugged Red River Gorge in Kentucky; the Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina; Ocala National Forest in Florida; and the deadly White Mountains in New Hampshire. However, The Boys don't plan on stopping here. In the summer of 2017, the real adventure starts; the Pacific Crest Trail.
 	Starting July 1st, The Boys intend on hiking every step of the 2650 miles that the PCT has to offer.</p>

    <p>In an effort to save a little money and waste a little time, The Boys took to making their own gear. <br>Do-It-Yourself projects include: tents, tarps, ultralight quilts, bivy sacks, a poncho tarp, rain jackets, rain pants, rain kilts (??), hats, and even a couple pairs of ill-fitting mittens. </p>
